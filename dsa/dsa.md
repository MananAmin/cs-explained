# Data Structures and Algorithms

There are tons of good resources out there for DSA, So it's really hard to choose one. These are the few my favourite ones.

 It's like university lectures, so you will get both theoritical and practial aspects of DSA.
 I think, It's kinda perfect balance between both theroy(proofs) and practical (pseudo code)
 I highly recommend it to university students.
 Though, If you're only interested in Data structures without any proofs(theory) then, you might want to skip some parts.

 data structures in c or c++.  Pre-requisite for this lesson is good understanding of pointers in C.
